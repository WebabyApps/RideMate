/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for RideMate.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and a combination of ownership and shared access for rides and chat messages.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Access is restricted to the owner of the profile.
 * - /rides/{rideId}: Stores ride information. Access is controlled by the ride offerer and participating riders.
 * - /ratings/{ratingId}: Stores ride ratings. Access is controlled by the rater and rated user.
 * - /rides/{rideId}/messages/{messageId}: Stores chat messages for a specific ride. Access is limited to participants of the ride.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Ride creation is open to authenticated users, while modifications are restricted to the ride offerer. Riders can't modify ride.
 * - Ratings can be created by authenticated users but updates are not allowed.
 * - Chat messages are restricted to users participating in the associated ride.
 * - Listing rides and ratings is allowed to all users. Listing messages is not allowed directly.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Rides: Includes `offererId` to easily identify the ride creator for authorization.
 * - Ratings: Includes both `raterId` and `ratedUserId` to check who created the rating and who is being rated.
